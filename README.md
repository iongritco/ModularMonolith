# ModularMonolith
A playground for experimenting projects with a Modular Monolith Architecture - DDD, CQRS, MediatR, .NET 7, Entity Framework Core

To get started, just create the database ToDo and ToDo_Tests and update the connection string in appsettings - the migration will be executed automatically on the first run.
